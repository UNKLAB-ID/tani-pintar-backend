        Filter posts based on privacy settings and user relationships.

        This method implements the core privacy logic for the social media platform,
        determining which posts a given user can see based on their authentication
        status, relationship with post authors, and post privacy settings.

        Privacy Rules:
            - Anonymous users: Only PUBLIC posts
            - Authenticated users: PUBLIC posts + own posts + FRIENDS posts from mutual followers
            - ONLY_ME posts: Only visible to the post author

        Args:
            user (User | None): The user requesting to view posts. Can be None for
                anonymous users or unauthenticated requests.

        Returns:
            QuerySet[Post]: Filtered queryset containing only posts visible to the user.

        Performance Notes:
            - Uses database indexes on privacy field for efficient filtering
            - Performs 3 database queries for mutual follower detection
            - Consider caching friendship relationships for high-traffic scenarios

        Examples:
            # Get posts visible to anonymous user
            visible_posts = Post.objects.visible_to_user(None)

            # Get posts visible to authenticated user
            visible_posts = Post.objects.visible_to_user(request.user)
